1. Download the latest .vsix file from the onedrive link.
2. Turn off "Allow Anonymous Telemetry" in the user settings. This will stop DbSaicle from attempting requests to PostHog for [anonymous telemetry](https://docs.dbsaicle.dev/reference/telemetry).
3. In your `config.yaml` file (or through the DbSaicle UI), set the default model to a local model. You can find available local model options.
4. Restart VS Code to ensure that the changes to `config.yaml` take effect.
