as tools. The tool names should start with jira_ as suffix for the tool. 
The tool implementations should use the jira_domain, jira_api_token, jira_auth_email values from config.
Add these jira tools to builtin tools. 
Please ensure that tool implementations for 'jira_*' are called on invocation of the tool.
**Important** refer earlier tools defintions as template.
